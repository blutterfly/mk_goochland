# Sun-Powered Aquaponics Loop

A single, hands‑on station where students build and run a **solar‑powered aquaponics garden**:

| Component             | How it’s Shown in the Activity                                                                                                     | Key Take‑aways                                                     |

| **Hydroponics**       | Raft or media bed where lettuce or basil roots dangle directly in nutrient‑rich water.                                             | Plants can grow without soil if they receive balanced nutrients.   |
| **Aquaculture**       | 20–40 L fish tank (tilapia or goldfish) that supplies ammonia‑rich waste.                                                          | Fish provide natural fertilizer for plants.                        |
| **Water Circulation** | Submersible DC pump moves fish‑tank water up through the grow bed and back via gravity. Clear tubing lets students trace the flow. | Closed‑loop systems recycle water, reducing consumption by \~90 %. |
| **Solar Power**       | 20–30 W photovoltaic panel feeds a small charge‑controller and 12 V battery powering the pump.                                     | Renewable energy can keep food systems running off‑grid.           |

## How the Demo Runs

1. **Morning “Kick‑Start”** – Students assemble the loop, wire the panel → charge controller → battery → pump, and check flow rate with a measuring cup & stopwatch.
2. **Nutrient Cycle Spotlight** – Test water for ammonia, nitrites, nitrates; watch levels drop as plants absorb nutrients.
3. **Energy Math** – Compare pump watt‑hours to solar panel output; track surplus/deficit on a sunny vs. cloudy day.
4. **Fish‑to‑Fork Challenge** – Harvest herbs grown over several weeks to garnish a simple snack prepared on‑site.

## Why It Works

* One compact build demonstrates **four STEM topics simultaneously**.
* Visual water flow and live fish keep engagement high.
* Scales easily: tabletop version for classroom, 300‑gallon version for the greenhouse.

Use this as a cornerstone exhibit in your Education Zone—kids remember the “fish‑powered veggie garden that ran on sunshine.”
