# Van‑Life Innovation Station

*A hands‑on exhibit that lets visitors explore every major system of a DIY camper‑van build—then compare it to quick‑convert SUV/mini‑van options.*

| Module                                         | What Guests See / Do                                                                                                                                             | Decisions & Trade‑offs                                                                                | Pro‑Tips from Your Builds (RAM Promaster & Ford Transit)                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Shell & Layout Planning**                 | Side‑by‑side floor‑tape outlines: Promaster 159 WB, Transit 148 WB, Kia Carnival mini‑van. Visitors place cardboard “furniture” blocks to test layouts.          | High‑roof vans allow standing; mini‑vans force seated cooking but cost < ½.                           | Promaster’s squared walls simplify straight cabinetry; Transit’s taper requires scribing panels—budget an extra weekend.                                                  |
| **2. Insulation & Temperature Control**        | Interactive wall cut‑away: factory metal → sound‑deadener → 1″ XPS → vapor barrier → cedar tongue‑&‑groove. IR thermometer compares sun‑baked vs. shaded panels. | • Foam ≥ R‑5 keeps summer heat out, winter heat in.  <br>• Too much vapor barrier traps moisture.     | Combine 3M Thinsulate in cavities + 1/2″ foam board on flat panels—quiet *and* warm. Install MaxxAir fan + 2 DIY passive floor vents for airflow.                         |
| **3. Electrical & Solar**                      | Working 400 W roof array feeds Victron MPPT, 200 Ah LiFePO₄, inverter. Guests toggle loads (fridge, laptops) and watch shunt display.                            | • LiFePO₄ beats AGM on lifespan/weight. <br>• Aim for ≈ 200 W solar per full‑timer.                   | Your Promaster runs 2 × 100 Ah Li‑Time batteries under the driver’s seat—balances weight + stealth. Install shore‑power port behind license plate to keep exterior clean. |
| **4. Refrigeration & Galley**                  | Cut‑away of 12 V compressor fridge vs. thermoelectric cooler. Visitors feel inside temps, read amp‑draw meters.                                                  | Compressor units sip 30–45 Ah/day; thermoelectric doubles that and only cools 30 °F below ambient.    | You top‑loaded a BougeRV 45 qt fridge in the Promaster and framed a slide‑out under the bed—zero floor loss.                                                              |
| **5. Water & Plumbing**                        | Clear 20 L fresh + 20 L grey jugs; foot‑pump sink. Try a DIY outdoor shower bag warmed by sun.                                                                   | Keep tanks < 10 gal each if stealth‑camping; larger tanks need venting and weight planning.           | Inline AquaBrick filter lets you refill any spigot on the road—no bottled water.                                                                                          |
| **6. Sleeping Solutions**                      | Flip‑up slat bed (Promaster) vs. tri‑fold plywood platform (Ford Transit) vs. fold‑flat minivan seats + air‑mattress. Visitors fold/ unfold each.                | Permanent beds = comfort, sacrifice daytime space; convertible beds = daily hassle, more lounge room. | Promaster: “East‑West” 54″ width fits short sleepers; add 4″ boxes in window wells for extra shoulder room.                                                               |
| **7. Mobile Office**                           | Swing‑out Lagun table with monitor arm; demo Starlink + 5G router. Guests test latency vs. cell hotspot.                                                         | Hard‑mount monitor shakes on washboard roads—use VESA quick‑release to stow while driving.            | Transit build: set 12 V outlets at desk and bench—no dangling cables.                                                                                                     |
| **8. Climate & Stealth**                       | Compare blackout magnetic window covers vs. Reflectix inserts; decibel meter gauges outside noise leakage.                                                       | Blackout + fan = stealth; rooftop AC screams “RV.”                                                    | Your Promaster: Diesel heater with under‑van tank keeps fumes outside; heater vent exits in step‑well—hidden from view.                                                   |
| **9. Safety & Legal**                          | Fire‑extinguisher demo, CO/propane alarms, National Forest “dispersed camping” map.                                                                              | Know local ordinances—some cities ban overnight parking.                                              | Register as “Motorhome” in VA: requires bed, galley, storage; lowers insurance vs. commercial van.                                                                        |
| **10. Quick‑Convert Camping (SUV / Mini‑Van)** | 5‑minute challenge: team folds rear seats, drops in laser‑cut platform + 4″ foam, deploys battery box & tailgate awning.                                         | Great for weekenders; no permanent mods, fits HOA rules.                                              | Keep a pre‑packed Rubbermaid “galley bin” and Jackery power station—go from driveway to campsite in < 20 min.                                                             |

### Exhibit Flow

1. **Orientation (5 min)** – Map of your two vans + mini‑van option; highlight cost tiers.
2. **Self‑Guided Stations (30 min)** – Visitors collect “build tokens” after completing small tasks (e.g., wire a fuse, fit insulation).
3. **Demo Drive‑Through (optional)** – Park the RAM Promaster in the event meadow; run AC loads off solar to show true off‑grid capability.
4. **Q & A Campfire (evening)** – Share cross‑country experiences: fuel costs, stealth nights at Cracker Barrel, boondocking apps.

### Key Considerations to Emphasize

* **Weight & Payload** – Promaster 2500: \~4,000 lb capacity; Transit 150: \~3,200 lb. Budget 50 lb per linear foot of cabinetry.
* **Center‑of‑Gravity** – Batteries low & centered; water opposite fridge to balance.
* **Temperature Extremes** – 1″ insulation + vent fan ≈ 10 °F drop vs. outside; add shade awning for another 5 °F.
* **Noise & Vibration** – 80 mil butyl mats on wheel wells cut road roar by 30 %.
* **Redundancy** – Dual‑fuel stove (propane + butane) ensures cooking at altitude; DC fridge still runs if inverter dies.
