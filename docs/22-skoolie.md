## 1 Interactive Build Modules

| Station                                             | What Guests See / Do                                                                                                          | Decisions & Trade‑offs                                                                    | Pro‑Tips from Your Builds                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Shell Assessment & Seat Removal**                 | Pull a seat out with impact wrench; inspect under‑frame on a lift.                                                            | Rust versus price; diesel vs. gasoline; roof height (flat‑top vs. dog‑nose).              | School auctions list buses for **\$4–6 k** with service records—target ≤ 150 k mi and southern states for minimal road‑salt rust. |
| **Insulation & Sub‑Floor**                          | Try 3 options: 1″ XPS foam, sheep’s‑wool batts, spray foam. Use FLIR camera to see heat escape.                               | Spray foam = best R‑value, but costly and permanent.                                      | On the 50‑seater you foam the ribs + run radiant‑barrier over sub‑floor; handicap bus gets recycled denim for quieter ride.       |
| **Layout & Framing**                                | Full‑scale tape outlines: queen bed, galley, wet‑bath, desk. Guests rearrange IKEA box props.                                 | Center aisle vs. side aisle; bulkhead placement around wheel wells.                       | Raise the bed on the 20‑seater to clear wheel‑chairs + create “garage” for batteries.                                             |
| **Electrical & Solar Rooftop**                      | Climb scaffold to aim tilt‑mount 800 W array. Victron display shows live watts; kids pedal a generator bike to feel the load. | Flat roof = easy solar; roof hatch may need relocating.                                   | 50‑seater: 8 × 100 Ah LiFePO₄ in rear bay; handicap bus keeps two batteries mid‑ship for weight balance.                          |
| **Plumbing & Bathroom**                             | Mock‑up wet‑bath with prefab fiberglass pan. Visitors glue PEX joints, pump grey water to clear tank.                         | Weight & freezing protection; composting toilet vs. RV black tank.                        | Urine‑diverting composting toilet saves 40 gal black tank space.                                                                  |
| **Galley & Refrigeration**                          | Test 12 V drawer fridge vs. residential mini‑fridge (inverter).                                                               | Drawer fridge uses half the amps and survives bumps.                                      | Build a slide‑out pantry in unused stairwell of 50‑seater.                                                                        |
| **HVAC & Temperature Control**                      | Operate mini‑split heat pump and diesel heater side‑by‑side; decibel meter for noise.                                         | Mini‑split efficient on shore‑power; diesel heater great for boondocking.                 | Insulate ceiling *before* installing rooftop units to avoid condensation drip.                                                    |
| **Mobile Office & Connectivity**                    | Sit at flip‑down desktop; test 5G router + Starlink.                                                                          | Roof deck may shade solar but gives antenna height.                                       | Handicap lift doubles as *rear porch*—ideal Starlink mount.                                                                       |
| **Accessibility & Multipurpose Lift** *(20‑seater)* | Ride the lift with cargo crate; discuss gear‑loading benefits.                                                                | Adds 400 lb but can hoist motorcycles, kayaks.                                            | Install removable rails so lift converts to patio platform.                                                                       |
| **Exterior & Finishing**                            | Visitors mask windows, roll low‑VOC marine paint, install cedar slats on roof‑deck rail.                                      | School‑bus yellow illegal on RV—must repaint.                                             | Rust‑oleumed entire undercarriage first; used white elastomeric roof coating for extra R‑value.                                   |
| **Registration, Insurance & Safety**                | Compare DMV checklists, CO alarms, escape hatch demo.                                                                         | Some states require RV conversion (bed + kitchen + storage) to drop commercial insurance. | VA title swap: weight slip + four photos satisfied “motor‑home” criteria; insurance dropped by 50 %.                              |

## 2 Cheat‑Sheet: 50‑Seater vs. 20‑Seater

| Feature               | 50‑Seater (Full‑Size)                                       | 20‑Seater Handicap                                               |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Length / Height       | 40 ft × 10 ft interior                                      | 24 ft × 8 ft interior                                            |

## 3 Workshop Flow

1. **Rust & Records 101** – Walk visitors through pre‑purchase checklist: frame rust, blow‑by test, service logs, emergency brake.
2. **Gutting Party** – Volunteers unbolt seats, cut seat‑legs flush, sort metal for recycling funds.
3. **“Choose Your Insulation”** – Teams compete for lowest thermal loss in a heat‑lamp test rig.
4. **Solar‑Up‑Top Challenge** – Hoist a 200 W panel to roof rack using handicap lift; wire MC‑4 connectors.
5. **Fin‑o‑Clock** – Roll primer, tape stripes, reveal final paint scheme; kids add magnetic decals.
6. **Overnight Trial** – Select volunteers camp in buses onsite, logging temps, noise, energy draw. Debrief next morning.

## 4 Key Acquisition & Build Considerations

| Area               | What to Watch                                                              | Your Experience                                                                                    |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Drivetrain**     | Pre‑2010 diesels may need costly emissions retrofit in some cities.        | 2007 CAT C7 in 50‑seater runs cleaner than 2004 DT466; parts widely available.                     |
| **Roof Height**    | Standard = 6 ft 2″; “FS‑65 high‑top” = 6 ft 6″; roof‑raise adds \$4–6 k.   | You skipped roof raise by designing drop‑aisle lounge in 50‑seater.                                |
| **Windows**        | Great light but thermal loss; consider deleting every other pane.          | Replaced four windows with FRP panels for cabinets.                                                |
| **Weight Balance** | Batteries & water low and between axles; heavy galley opposite slide‑door. | Handicap bus: lift & wheelchair gear already weight one side—balanced with galley / bath opposite. |
| **Licensing**      | Most states allow < 26 k lb on regular license once titled as RV.          | VA DMV accepted photos + weight slip; no CDL needed.                                               |

## 5 Volunteer Engagement & Outreach

* **Seat‑Pull Saturdays** – 4 hours = 48 seats gone; scrap metal pays for pizza.
* **Paint‑Your‑Panel** – Local artists paint a story square; assemble mosaic exterior.
* **Trade Skill Nights** – Electricians, plumbers, carpenters each lead one evening.
* **STEM Field‑Trip Tie‑In** – Students wire 12 V lighting circuits; compare amperage vs. LED strip.

---

## 6 End‑Goal Display

Park both completed skoolies near the greenhouse:

* 50‑Seater → **Family Tiny Home** with queen bed, bunks, full galley, wet‑bath, hybrid desk‑dining booth.
* 20‑Seater → **Adventure Rig / Accessibility Showcase** with gear‑garage, lift‑patio, compost toilet, workstation.

Visitors experience off‑grid living, energy dashboards, and accessibility innovations—reinforcing that smart design + community sweat‑equity can deliver **debt‑free housing on wheels**.
