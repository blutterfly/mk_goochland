## Next Steps (if any of these resonate)

1. **Map Zones**
   Sketch your 15 acres into activity hubs (quiet vs. active, wet vs. dry, wooded vs. open). A simple GIS layer or even paper map helps identify overlaps and buffer zones (e.g., weddings need quiet, obstacle course can be louder).

2. **Check Zoning & Permits (Goochland County)**

   * Agritourism uses often fall under “by‑right” farm exemptions but events >200 guests may need a special‑event permit.
   * Talk early with the county’s Community Development Dept. about parking, septic, and ingress/egress.

3. **Phase‑In Plan**

   * **Phase 1** (low‑capex): hiking trail, pollinator meadow, small CSA, photography rentals.
   * **Phase 2**: glamping/tiny houses, farm‑to‑table dinners, obstacle course.
   * **Phase 3**: full event barn, renewable‑energy exhibits, summer camps.

4. **Explore Grants & Partnerships**
   USDA Sustainable Ag grants, Virginia Farm Bureau Rural Business Development, and local extension offices can offset initial costs.

5. **Brand & Marketing**

   * Unified theme (e.g., “Living STEM Farm & Retreat”).
   * Cross‑sell between weddings (“stay for a minimoon in our glamp tents”) and school visits (“return for family farm fest”).
