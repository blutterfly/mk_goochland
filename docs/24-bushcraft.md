## 1 ⸺ Mindset & Safety First

| Principle                             | What It Means in the Field                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Plan → Practice → Perform**         | Rehearse skills at home, then do overnight field tests before trusting them in an emergency.        |
| **“Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.”** | Rushing a shelter or fire setup burns calories and risks mistakes; deliberate actions win daylight. |
| **Layered Redundancy**                | Two ways to start fire, purify water, navigate, and signal—minimum.                                 |
| **Leave No Trace**                    | Harvest materials sustainably; scatter micro‑debris; respect local regulations.                     |

## 2 ⸺ Essential Knots Short‑List   *(learn these seven and you cover 95 % of field tasks)*

| Knot                         | Core Use                                             | Memory Aid                                           | Downsides                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Figure‑8 on a Bight**      | Fixed loop for carabiner or tarp corner              | Shape looks like “8”                                 | Bulky for small cordage                     |
| **Bowline**                  | Non‑slip loop around object or waist                 | “Rabbit comes out the hole, around tree, back down.” | Can loosen if shaken un‑loaded; add stopper |
| **Taut‑Line Hitch**          | Adjustable guy‑line tension                          | Two wraps down, one wrap up                          | Slips on silnylon slick cord                |
| **Trucker’s Hitch**          | High‑tension ridge‑line                              | One fixed loop + pulley effect                       | Remember half‑hitches to secure             |
| **Clove Hitch + Half‑Hitch** | Quick anchor to pole                                 | “Second wrap crosses first = clover”                 | Can roll on square poles                    |
| **Sheet Bend**               | Join two ropes of unequal size                       | “Tail of smaller wraps the big, back under itself.”  | Not for slippery nylon without double turn  |
| **Prusik Loop**              | Slide‑and‑grip loop (ascender, adjustable gear hang) | 3 wraps around line tightens under load              | Needs cord smaller than main line           |

> **Practice Drill:** Tie each knot five times blind‑folded; finish under 60 seconds total.

## 3 ⸺ Shelter Craft

1. **Site Selection (the 5 “W’s”)**

   * **Wind** – downwind of prevailing gusts
   * **Water** – 200 ft away to avoid damp & flooding
   * **Widow‑makers** – no dead branches overhead
   * **Wildlife** – check tracks, scat
   * **Wood** – ample building fuel nearby

2. **Quick‑Deploy Options**

   * **Tarp A‑frame:** ridge‑line + 6 stakes (≤ 5 min)
   * **Lean‑to:** ridge‑pole between trees, angled roof of sticks/leaves (≤ 45 min)
   * **Debris Hut:** tripod, spine pole, rib sticks, 2‑ft leaf layer (4–6 hrs; cold‑weather)

3. **Insulation & Moisture**

   * **Ground:** 4″ compacted duff or pad = 15 °F warmth gain
   * **Roof:** debris layer = thickness of your arm to shed rain

| **Fire Lay**        | Twig bundle → pencil → thumb → wrist sticks, teepee or log‑cabin style                                                                             | Stage fuel by size before striking spark                         |
| **Cooking Methods** | • Pot over coals (rock tripod)<br>• Reflector oven (foil + stakes) for bannock<br>• Coal‑bake tubers wrapped in bark<br>• Stick roast, bush kebabs | Hang pot via adjustable pot‑hanger knot (prusik on green branch) |

## 5 ⸺ Water Procurement & Purification

1. **Find** – seeps, plant transpiration bags, depressions on rock faces, snow melt.
2. **Filter** – improvised sand/charcoal layer or commercial squeeze filter (0.1 µ).
3. **Purify** – **boil 1 min rolling (3 min > 6,500 ft)**; chemical tabs 30 min; UV pen 90 sec.
4. **Store** – wide‑mouth bottle for collecting, clean bladder for drinking; label to prevent mix‑up.

## 6 ⸺ Survival Priorities (Rule of 3)

| Need        | Reference        | Practical Action                                                                   |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Air**     | 3 minutes        | Signal, free airway, treat smoke inhalation.                                       |
| **Shelter** | 3 hours exposure | Erect tarp; change wet clothes; insulate ground.                                   |
| **Water**   | 3 days           | Start purification cycle immediately—water work takes time.                        |
| **Food**    | 3 weeks          | Carry 2,500 kcal dense rations; practice snares/fishing only after core needs met. |

## 8 ⸺ Skill‑Building Progression

1. **Backyard Weeknight** – pitch tarp & cook with headlamp only.
2. **24‑Hour Minimalist** – single‐knife, ferro rod, and 10 items list.

Document each outing; iterate gear and habits.
